<h2>Application inspection # Application</h2>

<p>It's time to put the acquired knowledge into practice. We have a small application running much slower than it should. The problem is that the application takes a long time to start when you press the "Start" button. To fix the problem, you must find out which function is slowing down the application launch.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Run the app on an emulator or your physical device.</li>
	<li>Find out which function is slowing down the loading of the application when you press the "Start" button.</li>
	<li>Assign the name of the slow function to the <code>solution</code> variable as the String type.</li>
</ol>

<p>[HINT] Luckily, the developers who messed up the code took care of you and added custom trace events. [/HINT]</p>
