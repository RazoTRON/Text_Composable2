<h2>Slow app # Application</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, it is usually impossible to write an application without making mistakes. It often happens that one fix causes another error to appear. Your task is to find the function that caused the slow loading of the application.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Run the app on an emulator or your physical device.</li>
	<li>Find out which function is slowing down the loading of the application when you press the "Start" button.</li>
	<li>Assign the name of the slow function to the <code>solution</code> variable as the String type.</li>
</ol>
